Django Hydrus web client for sharing files

This is a basic example python-django app to let people view your hydrus files remotely. Think of it like a discount Hydrus-Web, or a knockoff Hyshare (check those out by the way)
You will need to adjust the .env file based on your use-case, so read the commands.txt file to see what you need to do depending on if you're going with Docker or running as is.

Note: This is by default only for viewing files. There is no management or adjusting of files, nor is there account management.
